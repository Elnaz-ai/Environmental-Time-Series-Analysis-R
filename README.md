\# Environmental Time-Series and Trend Analysis Using R



Applied analysis of environmental monitoring data using R, with a focus on

time-series analysis, trend detection, seasonality, and meteorological influence.



\## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of R for analyzing long-term environmental

monitoring data. The analysis focuses on identifying temporal patterns,

seasonal variability, and long-term trends using robust statistical and

visualization techniques.



While the dataset analyzed relates to air quality monitoring, the analytical

approach is directly transferable to climate, hydrologic, and water-quality

datasets commonly used in environmental and watershed management.
